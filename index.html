    <h2 class="titulochico">PGL MAJOR ANTWERP TEAM LIST FINALIZED</h2>
    <p class="textoDescrip">After two weeks of qualifiers, the 24 teams we will see in action in Belgium from May 9-22 are set.
        The Regional Major Ranking events have concluded in Bucharest following the end of the second European competition, which means that we have learned all 24 names who will participate in the most prestigious tournament CS:GO has to offer in a few weeks' time.
        The qualifiers began two weeks ago with the Americas, where FURIA claimed the only Legends spot on offer and were joined by Liquid and Complexity as the next two biggest favorites, along with MIBR, Imperial, and 9z — leaving teams such as Evil Geniuses, 00NATION, and paiN without a Major spot.
        Asia followed with IHC coming out on top as the surprising victors and claiming the first Contender spot on offer, breaking the status quo that had seen Renegades and TYLOO dominate the region for years. In a matchup between the two favorites for the second spot, the Australian side bested Hansel BnTeT Ferdinand and company and eliminated them from contention.
    </p>
    <p class="textoDescrip">The European "super-region" was spread out across two groups to close out the qualifiers. In the first, BIG and Heroic went undefeated as they upset FaZe and Natus Vincere, before the world's two best teams ended up securing the other two of the four Legends spots.
        forZe went 3-1 en route to qualification as one of the most surprising names to go through from the group of death. Meanwhile, Outsiders and Vitality only barely scraped through with a 3-2 record alongside the Turkish superteam Eternal Fire, another big underdog heading into the event. MOUZ, OG, and fnatic were the biggest names not to make it to Antwerp from the difficult first group.
        The second European event had three Legends spots on offer, which went to 3-0 teams Copenhagen Flames and Players — who have since joined Cloud9 — as well as NIP. ENCE and G2 also made it but will have to start the Major in the Challengers stage, along with Astralis, Spirit, and Bad News Eagles, with the latter team making history for Kosovo as the first from the country to make it to any stage of a Major.
