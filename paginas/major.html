    <h2 class="titulochico">Venue and city of Antwerp</h2>
        <p class="textoDescrip">One of the biggest arenas for CS:GO
            The playoffs of the PGL Major, slated for 19-22 May, will take place in the Antwerps Sportpaleis. The multipurpose hall seats 18,400 people for sporting events and can hold up to 23,359 at maximum capacity, making it larger than the LANXESS Arena in Cologne or the Avicii Arena in Stockholm.
            The venue was built for sporting events with a focus on track cycling, but now mostly hosts music events. According to Billboard Magazine, Antwerps Sportpaleis is the second most visited event hall in the world, second only to the Madison Square Garden. The venue is just a 30-minute walk from the center of Antwerp, and a 30-minute drive away from the Brussels Airport.

    <h3 class="titulochico">Well-connected in Western Europe</h3>
    <p class="textoDescrip">The Major will take place in Belgium, the Western European country that sits between France, Germany, and the Netherlands. While Belgium has little history hosting large-scale Counter-Strike tournaments, its location allows for fans from all over Europe to travel to the event conveniently.

        The country had few notable CS:GO players over the years, with ScreaM and Ex6TenZ being the standout examples. The duo won multiple titles during the early years of the game, but moved away from Counter-Strike in 2020 to seek new challenges.
        
        Antwerp is the second-largest city in Belgium, with a metropolitan population of around 1,200,000 people. The port-city located on the River Scheldt is known for its diamond industry and trade, and is recognized for the electronic dance festival Tomorrowland which takes place 15 km outside of the city.

    <h4 class="titulochico">History of CS:GO Majors</h4>
    <p class="textoDescrip">
        CS:GO Majors are the biggest Counter-Strike event on the calendar. They have been hosted since 2013 by various tournament organizers, and backed by game developer Valve.
        
        DreamHack Winter 2013, the first Major since the release of Global Offensive, was won by fnatic who upset favorites NIP in the grand final. The, at the time, staggering $250,000 prize pool was supported by the community through the purchase of keys for the esports skin case, while those that watched Major matches live were rewarded by drops such as the prized Cobblestone Souvenir Package.
        
        In the early years, three Majors were held during a year, with each of them being played out within less than a week. From 2016 onwards, only two Majors are hosted each year, but the prize pool was increased to $1,000,000 and the events were continually expanded to accommodate for more extensive formats.
    </p>

    <h5 class="titulochico">Longer events and big arenas</h5>
    <p class="textoDescrip">MLG Columbus was the first Major to be held outside of Europe and the first one won by a non-European team, Luminosity Gaming, while Cloud9 secure North America their first and only Major trophy at ELEAGUE Boston in 2018. Teams such as Virtus.pro, LDLC, and Gambit won Majors over the years, but fnatic with three victories and Astralis with four stand out as the most successful Major teams of all times.
        The latest Counter-Strike World Championship was PGL Stockholm, taking place in Sweden in October-November of 2021. At the first Major held in over two years, Natus Vincere secured the title with a flawless performance, not dropping a single map.
    </p>
    <h5 class="titulochico">$1,000,000 for PGL Major Antwerp 2022</h5>
    <p class="textoDescrip">
      The PGL Antwerp Major will bring Majors back to the customary $1,000,000 prize pool, the same purse Counter-Strike Majors have had since the first Major of 2016, MLG Major Columbus, which raised the bar from the previous $250,000 prize pools that the first seven Majors from 2013 to 2015 had disbursed. The only exception since the million-dollar hike was introduced in 2016 was PGL Major Stockholm in 2021, which had $2,000,000 on the line, amassing its own pot as well as that from the canceled ESL One Rio Major, which was scheduled for 2020 but called off during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.
      The PGL Antwerp Major will be a top-heavy affair, with the winners taking a lion’s share of $500,000, half of the prize pool, but reaching the Major is still lucrative business for organizations as money is collected from the purchase of in-game items such as team stickers, which Valve then distributes. One big change made to stickers was decided at PGL Major Stockholm, as player signatures, which were typically minted for all players competing at a given Major since their introduction in 2013, were reduced to only those players who reached the playoffs.
